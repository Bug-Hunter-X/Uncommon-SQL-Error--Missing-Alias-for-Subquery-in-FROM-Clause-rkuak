The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause to count the number of orders for each customer, but it produces an error because the subquery lacks a name:

```sql
SELECT c.CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM Customers c,
(SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID) 
GROUP BY c.CustomerID;
```

This will result in a syntax error in most SQL dialects because a subquery in the FROM clause must be aliased.  The issue is the lack of an alias for the subquery that counts orders.
