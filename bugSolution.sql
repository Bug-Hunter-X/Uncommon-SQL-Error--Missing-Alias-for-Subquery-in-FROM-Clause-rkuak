The corrected SQL query includes an alias for the subquery:

```sql
SELECT c.CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM Customers c
JOIN (SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID) AS OrderCounts ON c.CustomerID = OrderCounts.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID;
```

Alternatively, a more efficient approach using a JOIN would be:

```sql
SELECT c.CustomerID, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS OrderCount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID;
```
This revised query correctly uses a subquery with an alias ('OrderCounts'), enabling proper referencing and avoiding the syntax error. The second example demonstrates a more efficient method using JOIN which generally performs better than nested queries.
